# Welcome to my repository!

Each project (Shopping Cart, Executive Dashboard, Robo Advisor) is accompanied by its own readme file in the sub directories to help you set up the projects. 

As per the requirements, this broader repository has been set up with:
1. a License file
2. Incremental branch development process
3. CI (pytests work at the individual project levels)


Thanks for a great semester!
